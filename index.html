            Blaise Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, France, June 19, 1623. 
            His father was a mathematician, while his mother died when he was 3 years of age, 
            and his family throughout most of his early life consisted of his father, sister, and maid. 
            Around his 18th year, and until his 24th, records claimed to say that it was stated in which he 
            was bedridden with pain, tolerating food only as a liquid, unable to chew for years.<br>
            <br>Later on, he would be known for his many inventions, such as, for example, “Pascal’s law”. 
            Supposedly, he’d also invented the syringe, hydraulics press, and a few other objects.<br>
